# Data Warehouse with Amazon Redshift

## Purpose

A startup called Sparkify wants to analyze the data they've been collecting on songs and user activity on their new music streaming app. The analytics team is particularly interested in understanding what songs users are listening to. Currently, they don't have an easy way to query their data, which resides in a directory of JSON logs on user activity on the app, as well as a directory with JSON metadata on the songs in their app.

## Project Datasets

### Song Dataset

The first dataset is a subset of real data from the [Million Song Dataset](https://labrosa.ee.columbia.edu/millionsong/). Each file is in JSON format and contains metadata about a song and the artist of that song. The files are partitioned by the first three letters of each song's track ID. 

### Log Dataset

The second dataset consists of log files in JSON format generated by this [event simulator](https://github.com/Interana/eventsim) based on the songs in the dataset above. These simulate activity logs from a music streaming app based on specified configurations.

The log files in the dataset are partitioned by year and month. 

## Schema Design

Using the song and log datasets, a **star schema** is created and optimized for queries on song play analysis. This includes the following tables.

#### Fact Table

1. **songplay** - records in log data associated with song plays i.e. records with page `NextSong`
   - *songplay_id, start_time, user_id, level, song_id, artist_id, session_id, location, user_agent*

#### Dimension Tables

1. **user_table** \- users in the app
   - *user_id, first_name, last_name, gender, level*
2. **song** \- songs in music database
   - *song_id, title, artist_id, year, duration*
3. **artist** \- artists in music database
   - *artist_id, name, location, latitude, longitude*
4. **time** \- timestamps of records in **songplays** broken down into specific units
   - *start_time, hour, day, week, month, year, weekday*

## ETL Pipeline

* Load song data and log data to staging_events and staging_songs tables.
* Insert Into songplay, user_table, song, artist, and time tables from staging tables.

## Query example

```sql
SELECT * FROM songplay LIMIT 10
```
